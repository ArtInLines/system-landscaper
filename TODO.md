# TODO:

## Old Way:

-   Add more methods to System class
-   Add Events to System Class
-   Build SystemLandscape Class (with Events)
-   Add Support for JSON-Serialization of Classes
-   Add Support for different Views
-   Test Classes for System-Landscape-Graphs

## New Way

-   Create an API specification for the highest layer of abstraction
    -   think of support for different Views
    -   think of Event-Handling from Renderer
    -   think of support for custom positioning with Renderer
-   Create Plan for Class-Structure for said API
-   Create said Classes

## Further TODOs

-   Update Renderer for new Graph-Structure
    -   Potentially have to rebuild current Renderer
    -   Specifically need to support different Views
    -   Also support saving & loading of svg.
-   Potentially update DOMInputHandler
-   Rebuild View / Layout Classes
-   Test all Features
-   Add rough UI for adding Data to Nodes & Edges
