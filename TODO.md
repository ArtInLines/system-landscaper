# TODO:

In no particular order:

-   Integrate SystemLandscaper into Rendering with fitting event handling
-   Add support for different Views to SystemLandscaper / Layout / Renderer
-   Customize Layouting / Positioning
-   Add support for loading / saving positioning (maybe as svg???)
    -   Add support for stored starting positions for nodes / edges to renderer
-   Potentially update DOMInputHandler (specifically for view-support)
-   Further Testing
-   Add rough UI for adding Data to Nodes & Edges
