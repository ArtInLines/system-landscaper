# TODO:

In no particular order:

-   Add Interface (or class or something?) for layout-functions
-   Add support for loading / saving positioning (maybe as svg???)
    -   Add support for stored starting positions for nodes / edges to renderer -> via layout function
    -   Maybe store current Positions for different Views, to restore them when switching back to the view
-   Add Walker's Tree-Position algorithm
-   Add simple layout for groupings
    -   Renderer will need to be updated too, to show rectangles around groups for example
-   Add customizability for controls (scrolling, dragging, clicking, etc.)
-   Add Documentation
-   Show how to use the app in the UI
-   Clean up code & dependencies

-   Update usage of SVGs to be more accessible. See as a very short intro to the topic [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction#best_practices)
