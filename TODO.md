# TODO:

In no particular order:

-   Customize Layouting / Positioning specifically to support systemTrees
-   Add support for different Views to SystemLandscaper / Layout / Renderer
-   Add support for loading / saving positioning (maybe as svg???)
    -   Add support for stored starting positions for nodes / edges to renderer
-   Potentially update DOMInputHandler (specifically for view-support)
-   Further Testing
-   Add rough UI for adding Data to Nodes & Edges

-   Update usage of SVGs to be more accessible. See as a very short intro to the topic [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction#best_practices)
