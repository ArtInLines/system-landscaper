# System Landscaper

This Repository is a fork from [VivaGraphJS](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS), yet updated for a more specific purpose: Displaying and allowing the modification of IT-System-Landscapes. More info on this will be provided, if this repo ever goes public.

## Local Build

Run the following script:

```
git clone https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS.git
cd ./VivaGraphJS
npm install
npx gulp release
```

The combined/minified code should be stored in `dist` folder.
